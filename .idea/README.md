### Plan: 
1. Create a new  _______ IntelliJ project. (rest webservice?)
2. Create a git repository for the new project.
3. Add mail.jar and activation.jar files in your CLASSPATH. See [JavaEmails](http://www.tutorialspoint.com/java/java_sending_email.htm)


### Notes:
- **Purpose:** To store a centralized place for notes. Slack acts a main form of communication while this section would be more for things we need to keep in mind or look into.
